Title: This would be the perfect book to have at school
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on November 25, 2016
Review: Who We Are!, is a book for teaching children that in this world, there are lots of different people, and no-one is the same. From our skin, eyes, hair colour, to our height, weight, the clothes we wear and the way that we act, we are all different and unique.

It teaches children that it is good to be different, and that the world would be a boring place if we were all the same.

We go on a journey to Funland with Nellie, Gus, their baby brother Jake, and mum and dad. Whilst there, they notice that there are a lot of people and just how different everyone is.

The book, even-though it is only 40 pages long, does have a lot of text on each page. Because of the length of time it takes to actually read, and the subject it is covering, I would say this book is more for children aged between 6-10 years. Although younger children may just like to look at the illustrations, rather than read the book, as these too show that people are different.

This would be the perfect book to have at school, to educate children about the world and it‚Äôs occupants whilst they are young, and hopefully help them understand that it is perfectly normal for people to look different from themselves.

Title: Rambling, scientifically inaccurate
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 7, 2019
Review: We have a few other Robie Harris books (eg, It's Not the Stork) so I expected more out of this one. The text is rambly and disjointed, which I could probably deal with if it was substantial and accurate. Skin color is more about the amount/concentration of melanin, not about the color of melanin. I have no problem with anatomically correct words; I like Harris' books because they use them... So I expected more out of this book. Good message, but fail on execution. Will be returning.

Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on July 21, 2017
Review: I'm adding this one to my kid's bookshelf at home and also here at school to use in lessons on differences. I see books like these as community builders. The more we teach and remind children how important, wonderful, and normal differences are - the more we become connected on a deeper level.
